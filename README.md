# Mox Algorithmic Trading

üêç Welcome to the Portfolio Rebalance project!

## What we want to do:
1. Deposit into Aave : get % yield
2. Withdraw from Aave
3. Trade tokens through Uniswap for rebalancing portfolio:
   - Allocation: 30% USDC and 70% ETHs
5. Redeposit into Aave: get % yield

## Quickstart

1. Deploy to a fake local network that titanoboa automatically spins up!

```bash
mox run rebalance_portfolio
```

2. Run tests (no tests for the moment)

```
mox test
```
